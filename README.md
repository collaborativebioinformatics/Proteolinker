# ProteO-Linker
ProteO-Linker is a web-based protein expression analysis tool. It uses a Shiny interface built in R to examine [O-Link](https://olink.com/) data generated by their proteomics platform. Users are able to upload their data and a generate custom plots of expression data.

# Pathway Enrichment Analysis Pipeline

## Overview & Objective

The goal of ProteO-Linker is to provide a straightforward workflow for examining protein expression data generated by Olink assays. The tool performs quality checks, applies filtering, and supports downstream analysis such as differential expression and pathway enrichment. Users can visualize results through multiple plot types and export figures or tables for reporting. The objective is to lower the barrier for exploratory analysis of Olink data while keeping the workflow modular and easy to adapt.

## Methodology

ProteO-Linker implements a stepwise pipeline:

1. **Quality Control (QC) of Input Files**
   - For each uploaded parquet file, two checks are performed:
     1. Verify that the file is complete and correctly formatted  
     2. Report failed or warned samples/assays  
   - Provides users with a summary of QC status for each file  

2. **LOD Filtering**
   - Two filtering methods are available:
     1. Fixed LOD (values provided by Olink)  
     2. Standard deviation–based LOD (customizable)  
   - If applied, a volcano plot of all 6 sample controls is generated, showing proteins above and below LOD  

3. **Differential Expression (DE) Analysis**
   - Users may upload a list of differentially expressed proteins  
   - DE results can be visualized with volcano plots (protein name, fold-change, p-value)  
   - These outputs can be used as input for pathway enrichment  

4. **Visualization**
   - Histograms/heatmaps of protein expression linked to GO terms  
   - Confidence-based visualization of LOD filtering results  
   - Interactive volcano plots for DE analysis  

5. **Pathway Enrichment**
   - Enrichment analysis highlights pathways associated with significant proteins  
   - Currently supports simple t-tests; additional methods (FDR, Fisher’s test) planned for future development  

6. **Outputs**
   - PNG plots for visualization  
   - CSV files of selected proteins, samples, or enriched pathways  
   - Optional PDF report summarizing results
